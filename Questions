Interview Questions
--------------------
->This keyword in javascript:
"this" is not assigned a value until an object invokes the function where this is defined or used. this has the value of the invoking
object in most circumstances.
eg.
 $ ("button").click (function (event) {
    // $(this) will have the value of the button ($("button")) object​
// because the button object invokes the click () method​
    console.log ($ (this).prop ("name"));
    });

->The use of this in the global scope
In the global scope, when the code is executing in the browser, all global variables and functions are defined on the window object. 
Therefore, when we use this in a global function, it refers to (and has the value of) the global window object 
(not in strict mode though, as noted earlier) that is the main container of the entire JavaScript application or web page.
var firstName = "Peter",
    lastName = "Ally";
    function showFullName () {
    // "this" inside this function will have the value of the window object​
    // because the showFullName () function is defined in the global scope, just like the firstName and lastName​
    console.log (this.firstName + " " + this.lastName);
    }
