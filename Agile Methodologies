->Drawbacks of waterfall model:
1.End product is visible only late in the SDLC cycle.
2.Cost of re-work/changes in the SDLC cycle is very high.
3.Requirements need to be fixed in the beginning of the project.

->In waterfall each phase of the SDLC has a specific deadline and deliverables that flows into the next phase.Hence all requirements are
collected,then designed,code written,tested,integrated and deployed at the end.

->1.In agile,requirments are broken down into smaller modules and all the phases of SDLC are completed for it.Hence small pieces of working 
software get released frequently.
2.Agile is time boxed,iterative approch to deliver software that builds software incrementally from the start of the project,instead of 
trying to deliver it all at once at the end.
